# Python Ransomware

## Details
* This is my 3rd Year Project.
* It is a Python script that uses the **Fernet** python library to encrypt/decrypt files that are in the same folder as the ransomware script "**GameModv2.py**"
* Its motive was to understand and demonstrate how a ransomware attack works
* The ransomware script can be converted into a .exe file using "**pyinstaller**"
* The name and the logo of the .exe file can also be changed and made attractive, luring the public into downloading and opening it, leading to the execution of the ransomware attack
* Eg:
  * Name: AssassinsCreedBrotherhood-ModPremium.exe
  * Icon Image: "**https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/Assassins_Creed_brotherhood_cover.jpg**"  converted into .iso file
